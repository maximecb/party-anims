[DONE] TODO: Merry Christmas with glitching
- glitch to hs at random frames
=> we can pre-render a few glitch frames of both

[DONE] TODO: could we increase the glitch intensity when there's a beat?
- increase then decay

[DONE] TODO: pre-render frames for rescue anim
- make it smoother
=> do the logic for pre-rendering frames first

[DONE] TODO: code to detect r, k, n and switch mode
- draw a small square on the left or right

[DONE] TODO: try to implement animation switching code. Every 16 or 32 beats

[DONE] TODO: random vertical shift in glitch fn

[DONE] TODO: rescue glitch anim

[DONE] TODO: try to program KORHAL animation

[DONE] TODO: try to draw red lines between letter coordinates

[DONE] TODO: test with projector on the wall

[DONE] TODO: try alternating every two beats.
- may be able not to clear the buffer

[DONE] TODO: option for a simulated beat
--sim_beat

[DONE] TODO: get a simple alternating animation going
- beat-driven
=> KISS

[DONE] TODO: try to set up animation loop with fixed frame rate
- need to figure out current frame rate, time since last frame?
- compute effective fps, how much delay to add
t = time.time()

[DONE] TODO: fix wifi problem

[DONE] TODO: send a UDP packet on every beat to this device

[DONE] TODO: try to create line fading animation
np.random.randint(low, high=None, size=None, dtype=int)
Return random integers from low (inclusive) to high (exclusive).
