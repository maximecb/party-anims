# Party Animations

Visual or video animation programs I wrote to use on a projector screen
at parties. The programs are written in Python using numpy and OpenCV.

## Installation

```
# On Ubuntu or Raspbian, install required libraries
sudo apt-get install libportaudio2

# Install required Python packages
pip3 install pyftdi numpy sounddevice aubio
```
